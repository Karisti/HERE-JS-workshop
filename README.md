# HERE JavaScript Workshop 
Workshop using HERE  JS and REST APIs 


In this workshop we will learn to use the JS and REST APIs from the HERE Location Suite.

### [Step 1 : We render a map and place a marker on our current position](https://github.com/kuberaspeaking/Shruti-JS-workshop/blob/master/Step1.md)
### [Step 2 : We search for all EV charging stations around us and place markers on them](https://github.com/kuberaspeaking/Shruti-JS-workshop/blob/master/Step2.md)
### [Step 3 : We draw a cirle around our position](https://github.com/kuberaspeaking/Shruti-JS-workshop/blob/master/Step3.md)
### [Step 4 : We use isoline routing to find the EV charging stations actually closest to us.](https://github.com/kuberaspeaking/Shruti-JS-workshop/blob/master/Step4.md)
### [Beyond : Final code with visual customizations.](https://github.com/kuberaspeaking/Shruti-JS-workshop/blob/master/Step5.md)
